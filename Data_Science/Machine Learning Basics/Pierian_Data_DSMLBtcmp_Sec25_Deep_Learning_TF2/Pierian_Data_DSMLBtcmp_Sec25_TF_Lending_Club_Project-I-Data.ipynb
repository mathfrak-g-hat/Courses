    "# TensorFlow 2.0 Project - Predicting Loan Repayment\n",
    "# Part I: The Data\n",
    "### A. J. Zerouali 2021/09/02\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the project in Section 25 of Pierian Data's DSML course. It's covered (with solutions) in Lectures 143-151.\n",
    "* I'll do this project from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the description of the project. We'll be using two csv files: \"lending_club_loan_two\" modified from Kaggle, and \"lending_club_info\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### a) The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club. \n",
    "\n",
    "LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Our Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Main question: **Given historical data on loans with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model predicting wether or nor a borrower will repay their loan?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model! Our label here is the **\"loan_status\"** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Comments and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "0) This notebook will deal with the data only. There are other notebooks that deal with the neural nets, and these use clean data from the present notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I'm thinking of doing some hyperparameter optimization for the neural net of this project. The next line is from Google's HParams tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to avoid doing too much trial and error on my nets in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It would also be useful to paralellize the code. Here's the package to do this in Jupyter: https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. To use ipyparallel in Google Colab, have to install it using:\n",
    "           \n",
    "           !pip install ipyparallel\n",
    "           \n",
    "If I absolutely have to work with trial and error, might as well train several nets in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I might have to make models that don't include all categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
